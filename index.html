        <p>
          Even if we fight, even if we cry, even in the darkest nights or brightest days,
          I will always choose you. Every. Single. Time. ❤️

        <p>
          Through ups and downs, we are meant to be. You and me — forever, always, eternally.

          No matter what comes our way, I promise we’ll walk through it hand in hand.
